## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
create two pointer,first pointer put it on head and the second make it equal none
Iterating over the linked list and storing a reference to a current node, its previous node, and its next node.
In every iteration, after the next node is stored, the currentâ€™s node next pointer is pointed at the stored reference to the previous node.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
follow unit test to check if
everything worke fine
