## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
create to classes to applay a tree concept in data structur

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The big o:
1. time: o(n)
2. space: o(1)
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
these method to print the element insid the node and move insid tree
pre order: root-->left-->right
in order: left-->root-->right
post order: left --> right --> root
